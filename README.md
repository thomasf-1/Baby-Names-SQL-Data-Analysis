# Baby-Names-SQL-Data-Analysis

In this project, I am working with given American first names at birth from 1920 to 2020, sourced from the USA social security administration. There are 12,469 rows in this data set, called baby_names.

There are 4 columns in this set: 

*year* (the year)

*first_name* (first name)

*sex* (gender of first name)

*num* (number of babies with that first name in that year)


SQL skills used in this project include CASE WHEN, pattern matching with the LIKE operator, subqueries, common table expressions, and window functions.
